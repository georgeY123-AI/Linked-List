Let's compare the different types of linked lists: singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. We'll cover their structure, time complexity, and real-world use cases.

### 1. Singly Linked List

#### Structure
- Each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.
- The last node points to `None`.

#### Time Complexity
- **Access/Search**: O(n)
- **Insert at Beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at End**: O(n) (without tail pointer), O(1) (with tail pointer)
- **Delete**: O(n) (need to find the node and update pointers)

#### Use Case
- **Use When**: Memory is a constraint and operations are mostly on the head.
- **Real-World Example**: Implementing stacks, which require push and pop operations at the head.

### 2. Doubly Linked List

#### Structure
- Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
- The first node's `prev` points to `None`, and the last node's `next` points to `None`.

#### Time Complexity
- **Access/Search**: O(n)
- **Insert at Beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at End**: O(n) (without tail pointer), O(1) (with tail pointer)
- **Delete**: O(n) (finding the node takes O(n), updating pointers takes O(1))

#### Use Case
- **Use When**: You need to traverse the list in both directions or perform frequent insertions and deletions at both ends.
- **Real-World Example**: Browser history, where you can move forward and backward through the pages.

### 3. Circular Linked List

#### Structure
- Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points to the first node, forming a circle.
- Can also be implemented as a circular doubly linked list.

#### Time Complexity
- **Access/Search**: O(n)
- **Insert at Beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at End**: O(n) (singly), O(1) (doubly)
- **Delete**: O(n) (finding the node takes O(n), updating pointers takes O(1))

#### Use Case
- **Use When**: You need a list that can be looped through indefinitely or require a continuous cycle.
- **Real-World Example**: Round-robin scheduling, where tasks are cycled through repeatedly.

### 4. Circular Doubly Linked List

#### Structure
- Combines features of doubly linked and circular linked lists.
- The last node's `next` points to the first node, and the first node's `prev` points to the last node.

#### Time Complexity
- **Access/Search**: O(n)
- **Insert at Beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at End**: O(1)
- **Delete**: O(n) (finding the node takes O(n), updating pointers takes O(1))

#### Use Case
- **Use When**: You need the benefits of both circular and doubly linked lists.
- **Real-World Example**: Music playlist where you can move forward and backward and loop through the songs.

### Summary Table

| Operation         | Singly Linked List | Doubly Linked List | Circular Linked List | Circular Doubly Linked List |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Access/Search     | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                 | O(n)                        |
| Insert at Beginning| O(1)              | O(1)               | O(1)                 | O(1)                        |
| Insert at End     | O(n) / O(1)        | O(n) / O(1)        | O(n) / O(1)          | O(1)                        |
| Delete            | O(n)               | O(n)               | O(n)                 | O(n)                        |

### When to Use Each Type

- **Singly Linked List**: Use when memory efficiency is important and operations are primarily on the head. Example: implementing stacks or simple lists.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Use when you need bidirectional traversal or frequent insertions/deletions at both ends. Example: browser history navigation.
- **Circular Linked List**: Use for applications requiring cyclic iteration or round-robin scheduling. Example: implementing a round-robin scheduler.
- **Circular Doubly Linked List**: Use for complex applications needing both cyclic iteration and bidirectional traversal. Example: music playlist management.

Each type of linked list has its strengths and ideal use cases, so the choice depends on the specific requirements of your application.
